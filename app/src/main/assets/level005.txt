TITLE Implication Introduction

DESCRIPTION START
In this Level you will learn how to create implication cards from almost nothing.
First thing you need to do is make an assumption. An assumption is just what it sounds like. We assume a card is present on the gameboard and 'poof'
we get that card on the gameboard. If we can derive/craft another card based on this assumption we can then create an implication card from our
assumption to the derived card.
Try this by making an assumption by click the toolbar in the topleft and selecting "Assumption"
