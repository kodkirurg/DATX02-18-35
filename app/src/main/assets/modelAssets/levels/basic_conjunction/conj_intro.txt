TITLE Conjunction Introduction

DIFFICULTY 0

DESCRIPTION START
Welcome to Gentzen's Quest and your first level!

In the area on the left you have expressions you know are true, and the quest is to prove the goal.

As for this level: If you know one expression is true, and that another one is true, you know that both expressions are true together.

Select each card and then select the "conjunction introduction" rule to as it appears on the right. This will create a new card with the two selected in conjunction as shown above.

Note that the order matters!
