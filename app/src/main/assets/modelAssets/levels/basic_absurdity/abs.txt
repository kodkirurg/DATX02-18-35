TITLE Absurdity

DESCRIPTION START
Now it's time to introduce a new type of card: Absurdity, shown above as the goal.

In formal logic, absurdity may be thought of something that is inherently false; a contradiction.

If you somewhere in your proof can ever reach absurdity, that means you have at least two cards contradicting eachother, meaning both can't be true at the same time.

If a card implies absurdity, that can be thought of opposite of the original card.
