TITLE Absurdity Elimination

DESCRIPTION START
In this level we'll learn about how absurdity can be used. If you ever reach absurdity, it means you've reached a logical contradiction in your proof.

As such, under a false premise, you can prove anything you want!

The rule you can use here is called "Absurdity elimination". This will open up the same editor used for "Implication introduction".
